<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> The course is
to study software engineering, such aprinciples, methods, and techniques for developing Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet of Things that are safety critical
</p>
<p>
The goal is
to gain greater design and implementation experience in embedded software development for CPS/IoT,
to learn basic systems capabilities needed to support IoT/CPS applications
to learn how to model, design, optimize, verify, implement, and validate safety-critical CPS/IoT in a principled manner.
</p>

Course materials are based on CIS441/CIS541 "Embedded Systems for Life-Critical IoT/CPS Applications" in University of Pennsylvania. I am very&nbsp; grateful for Prof. Insup Lee In U.Penn.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3>Problem (Project)-Based Learning  </h3>
This course will be given in Problem (Project)-based Learning, so that students find problems and solutions themselves and evaluate themselves and others.

	All PBL activities shall be done as a TEAM, not individual,

	No allowance of doing  task as individual.

	Lecturer of this course will be a coach and guides students to find problems, obstacles and ways to find solutions.

	For those reasons, students should be more pro-active than other courses.

	Details of PBL will be introduced to you in next class

<p>Class information, Lecture slides, Readings, Assignment descriptions, Schedules etc willl be provided at class homepage.
</p>

<p>Instant announcements, Questions, Assignment & Quiz submission
